# NYPD-Arrests-Dimensional-Model-and-Business-Intelligence
A database design and data ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) project

This project deals with 5M records. The NYPD arrests dataset was available as a CSV. Our goal for this assignment was to design a dimensional database for this data. Having brainstorm and design the ERD for this, we next went onto writing the SQL script for this. The major step of this assignment was to extract, transform & load (ETL) the data into the dimensional model. Talend jobs were created to perform this. Data was populated into Staging tables before further loading them into Facts and Tables. Tise directory contains all related files.
